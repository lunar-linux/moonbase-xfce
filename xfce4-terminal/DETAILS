cat << EOF
xfce4-terminal is a modern terminal emulator for the Unix/Linux desktop -
primarily for the Xfce desktop environment. We developed it because
we saw the need for a lightweight and easy-to-use terminal emulator
in the Xfce desktop environment, that doesn't require the user to
install the GNOME platform, but still provides a worthy alternative
to the GNOME terminal emulator.
